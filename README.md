# SignifyX

SignifyX is a multilingual fingerspelling recognition app designed to bridge communication gaps between the Deaf and hearing communities. Using AI-powered gesture recognition, SignifyX interprets American, French, and Arabic Sign Language alphabets in real-time.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Recognizes fingerspelling in English (ASL), French (LSF), and Arabic (ArSL).
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes MediaPipe's AI models for fast and accurate sign detection.
- **Offline Functionality**: No internet connection required, making it accessible anytime, anywhere.
- **Two APK Variants**:
  - One for **English & French** (ASL & LSF)
  - One for **Arabic** (ArSL)
- **Customizable Tracking Options**:
  - **Tracking Threshold**: Adjusts real-time accuracy vs. fluidity in sign detection.
  - **Presence Threshold**: Controls the app’s sensitivity in detecting a sign’s presence.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity for seamless usage.

## How It Works

1. Install and open SignifyX.
2. Position your hand within the camera frame.
3. The app detects the signed letters instantly.
4. Adjust tracking settings for a more personalized experience.
